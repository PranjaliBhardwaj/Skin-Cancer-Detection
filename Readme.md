# Skin Cancer Detection
This model will help you to detect skin cancer by early symptoms and also help you to detect  the same. 
## Problem statement
Early Detection Challenges: One problem related to skin cancer is the difficulty in early detection, particularly for individuals with numerous moles or irregular skin pigmentation. Identifying potentially cancerous lesions amidst a myriad of benign moles can be challenging for both patients and healthcare providers. This can lead to delays in diagnosis and treatment, allowing the cancer to progress to more advanced stages, where it becomes harder to treat effectively.
